# Traveling Salesman problem - Genetic Algorithms
## Problem Komiwoja≈ºera - Algorytmy Genetyczne

The project was created to practice genetic algorithms for the subject "Elements of Artificial Intelligence" at the University of Silesia.

At startup, the program tells you to select a file with paths to execute the algorithm. Examples of path files are: "bier127.tsp" and "pr144.tsp".

The parameters of the program are set to execute ten times, and each execution lasts 5 minutes. The results are saved to a text file.
